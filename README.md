# Automobile-Traffic-Recognition-System-based-on-Machine-Learning
We have made an Automobile Traffic Recognition using Machine Learning and deep Learning , We have used Keras and also we have used an Algorithm named as CNN ( Convolutional Neural Networks ). Along with this we have also made an dashboard of Accident Analysis with help of Power BI.

# Automobile-Traffic-Recognition-System-based-on-Machine-Learning
We have made an Automobile Traffic Recognition using Machine Learning and deep Learning , We have used Keras and also we have used an Algorithm named as CNN ( Convolutional Neural Networks ).
Along with this we have also made an dashboard of Accident Analysis with help of Power BI.
Also we have worked with Accident Analysis Data on SQL and also on Big Data Tools such as Hadoop and Apache Hive using ETL (Extract Transform Load) such as Sqoop i.e we have worked on Data Warehouse
